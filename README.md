# Space Mission Launch Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes historical space mission data to identify patterns, success factors, and trends in space exploration. It includes data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive visualizations.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step analysis
- `src/`: Python modules with reusable functions

## Features
- Analysis of launch success rates over time
- Comparison of mission costs across different space agencies
- Examination of relationships between payload mass and orbit achievement
- Geographical visualization of launch sites
- Predictive models for mission success probability
- Interactive dashboard for data exploration

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in sequence or explore the dashboard

## Data Sources
- Space missions dataset from Kaggle
- Additional launch data from NASA and Space-Track

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations such as:
- Time series analysis of launch success rates
- Geographical maps of launch sites
- Cost comparisons across agencies
- Predictive model performance metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Jupyter Notebooks for documentation
- Dash for interactive dashboard
